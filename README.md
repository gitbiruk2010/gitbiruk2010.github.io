# Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive, animated, and slightly sarcastic developer portfolio hosted via GitHub Pages.

---

## Project Overview

This is a responsive, theme-toggleable, single-developer portfolio built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and styled for both **dark** and **light** themes.

The main page features:
- A fixed hero **banner** with an animated code flow
- Collapsible sections for project experience and progress logs
- Developer humor injected into the visual experience (for sanity reasons)
